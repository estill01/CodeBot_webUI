# 💻🤖 CodeBot: Web UI

Fun mini-project to build something with the 2022-2023 vintage UI tooling and OpenAI API.

Has everything you'd need to build a fully-featured modern web UI.

## Built with

- 👻 [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) : Atomic state management
- ✨ [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (FKA ReactQuery) : async data fetcher (though swapped it for a simple `fetch`..)

- 🦾 [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) : Magial code generation machine

## Not Built With

- 🧱 [Formik](https://formik.org): Because I didn't need it yet; `createRef` will take you pretty far.

## Deployed
- ⛓ [IPFS](https://research.protocol.ai/publications/ipfs-content-addressed-versioned-p2p-file-system/): Decentralized file storage

## What's Next?

Not sure. I'll probably use this a template or morph it into something else I'm building.
