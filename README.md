# 💻🤖 CodeBot: Web UI

Fun mini-project to build something with the 2022-2023 vintage UI tooling and OpenAI API.

Has everything you'd need to build a fully-featured modern web UI.


## Built with

- ⚡️ [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev) : Build system / dev environment
- ⚛ React 18 : Still React, but now with more Hooks
- 👻 [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) : Atomic state management
- ✨ [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (FKA ReactQuery) : async data fetcher (though swapped it for a simple `fetch`..)
- 💨 [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) : The CSS system for tastemakers and enlightened individuals

## Not Built With

- 🧱 [Formik](https://formik.org): Because I didn't need it yet; `createRef` will take you pretty far.

## What's Next?

Not sure. I'll probably use this a template or morph it into something else I'm building.
